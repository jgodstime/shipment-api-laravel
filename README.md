Useful tips
===========

To connect to MySQL server use following credentials:

```
hostname: 127.0.0.1
port: 3324
username: docker
password: secret
```

To connect to your exiting MySQL database , edit your database credentials in `.env` but replace the host with the
following:

```
DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
```


Rebuild docker containers if they already exists
===========

This may be required if new dependencies have been added to the project or container. After the last changes were
pulled:

- if new dependencies were added both to the container and project:

```sh
docker-compose down
docker-compose build  (in rare cases with --no-cache)
```

Then run docker and enter to it

```sh
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec php bash
```

Install new project dependencies if they exist and update migrations (inside docker container)

```sh
composer install --prefer-dist
php artisan migrate
```

- if dependencies were added only to the project:

```sh
composer install --prefer-dist
php artisan migrate
```

- Login credentials for Admin

``` js
{
    "email": admin@gmail.com
    "password": password
}
```
